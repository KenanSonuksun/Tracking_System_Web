 # Tracking System Web
<br><br>
 The project is about a cargo tracking system which is a desktop application.
 <br><br>
The project is a desktop application. In this desktop application you have to sign in.If you have no account you need to sign up. All information is saved in the firebase
  real-time database. After signin in the home page opens. If the user is a customer, can select or add delivery point on map. If the user is a courier, can show the shortest 
  route between all points on map. I used Dijikstra Algorithm for finding the shortest route. If you add or delete a point while the program is running, my database can update 
  itself. And you can show courier's moving 
  
  The project has 4 important features;
     
  1) Communication with Google Cloud API
  2) The Shortest Route Algorithm (Dijikstra)
  3) After Changing Points or Others, Updating the Program Itself
  4) Design and Clean Code
